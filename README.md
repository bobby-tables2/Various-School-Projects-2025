# Various School Projects
Here is a random collection of small projects that I made that are mostly from 2025.
## Cartpole Balancing
I wrote an AI that can balance a simulated pole using Q-Learning. Code is in cartpole.ipynb and the model is in qpolicy.txt.
## Network Visualisation
test.ipynb contains sample code that can draws a graph using networkx.
## Optical Character Recognition and Object Tracking
ocr_and_tracking.ipynb contains code for reading and translating text from images, as well as code that allows the user to track a specific object from a video.
# Shape Recognition
This is the shape detetction code that I wrote for a competition as I mentioned in [a blog update.](https://bobby-tables2.github.io/jekyll/update/2023/01/03/SCSE-CC.html)
